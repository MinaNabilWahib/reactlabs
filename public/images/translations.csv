home_aim,The aim of this study is to understand your intuitions about the possible impact of self-driving cars on road safety. We will show you some solutions{comma} test your understanding{comma} and ask about your opinions. The study will take approximately 5 minutes to complete{comma} and you will receive 85 cents.,US
home_participation,Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you may refuse to participate or you may choose to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.,US
home_who,This study is a research project of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Human Development. The data collected will be used for research purposes only.,US
home_trafic,Traffic accidents in the world of self-driving cars,US
home_eliminate,Self-driving cars cannot eliminate all traffic accidents{comma} but they can still decrease the number of casualties on the road. Fewer pedestrians will die{comma} fewer bicyclists will die{comma} fewer motorcyclists will die{comma} and fewer car passengers will die.,US
home_question,The question{comma} though{comma} is how much fewer people will die in each of these categories. The way we program the self-driving cars will decide which category of users will profit the most from the added safety of self-driving cars.,US
home_example,For example{comma} we could program the cars to be especially protective of pedestrians{comma} in which case much fewer pedestrians will die{comma} but not so much fewer bicyclists{comma} motorcyclists{comma} or car passengers. But we could also make other decisions.,US
home_decisions,We will show you three possible decisions{comma} and ask how much you like them.,US
